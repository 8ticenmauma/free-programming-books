## What are the benefits of Windows Home Server 2011?
  
Windows Home Server 2011 is not just a file server, but a versatile platform that can enhance your home network and digital lifestyle. Here are some of the benefits of using Windows Home Server 2011:

- 64-bit functionality: Windows Home Server 2011 is 64-bit only, which means you can add more than 4GB of RAM and run more applications on your server. This also improves the performance and stability of your server.
- Better media server: Windows Home Server 2011 has robust media transcoding and streaming capabilities, and it supports a wide range of codecsâAAC, AVCHD, DivX, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, WMV, and more. Itâs now a DLNA 1.5-compliant server, meaning that DLNA-capable client devices can connect to a WHS system set up as a media server. You can stream your music, photos, and videos to your HDTVs, A/V receivers, game consoles, smartphones, tablets, and other devices.
- Windows 7 HomeGroups: You can add a WHS 2011 box to your HomeGroup, which makes sharing files and printers much easier. You can access your shared folders from any Windows 7 PC on your network without entering passwords. You can also use the HomeGroup feature to backup your PCs to the server automatically.
- Easier login management: Logging in to Windows Home Server 2011 is simpler than before. You don't need to use the same login credentials for your PC and your server. You can use an external application called the Dashboard to manage your server settings and features. The Dashboard also lets you monitor the health and status of your server and connected PCs.
- Remote access: Windows Home Server 2011 allows you to access your files and applications from anywhere with an internet connection. You can use a web browser or a mobile app to log in to your server remotely. You can also stream your media files or control your PC desktops remotely.
